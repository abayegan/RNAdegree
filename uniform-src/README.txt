In this model(B), the energy of each structure is zero, so the partition function Z is
the total number of structures of the given RNA, and the probability P(s) of each structure s is 1/Z.

Program computes the expected network degree (expected number of
neighbors) for the directed graph G = (V,E) , where V is the set of all
secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, and E is the set of directed
edges s â†’ t, where structure t is obtained from s by an element of move set
MS2 consisting of base pair additions, removals, and shifts, The algorithm is
not a simple extension of the algorithm for MS1, but requires entirely new
concepts and is surprisingly complex.

USAGE: ./uniformDegree rnaSequence [-ms1|-ms2]
where 
	rnaSequence: any sequence of upper or lowercase A,C,G,U characters
	-ms1 : moving set allowing addition and removal of base pairs.
	-ms2 : moving set allowing addition, removal and shift of base pairs.  

Output:
  two floating point numbers, where first is expected degree and second
  is expected degree divided by sequence length.

NOTE: Homopolymer case is hard coded and it can be used by setting HOMOPOLYMER variable to 1
in line 88 of aux.c file.
